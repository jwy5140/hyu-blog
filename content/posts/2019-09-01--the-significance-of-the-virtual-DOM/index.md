Today, we're going to take a quick look at what's happening under the hood with React.  

The reason for this blogpost is because I was recently presented with this question as part of a technical interview.
Though I've been presented some information here and there about why the virtual DOM is important, those details were difficult to recall at the time.  

To be straightforward - I didn't feel prepared to answer the question. This didn't feel good. Having experienced an education in engineering, I've been conditioned to know the why, before knowing the how. (I'm still having PTSD from you, PDEs.) After speaking with several friends of mine with more experience in the field, they too, were unable to produce an answer. It seemed strange, but I suppose we all took React a bit for granted. These days, documentation for the many frameworks we have really don't get into the grit of things. They work more like Ikea manuals - use this function here, and pass these arguments to it. To truly understand, one has to dive into the underlying code.  

However, lets save that for another day :) 

For now, we will just discuss the purpose and benefits of the virtual DOM.
