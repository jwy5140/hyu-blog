Hi there, I'm Jeff. Looks like you found your way onto my personal website! Welcome!

To introduce myself - I originally graduated university with a Bachelor's degrees in Engineering and Russian, but am currently pursuing Software Engineering.

There are so many possibilities to create, improve, and help through the applications that we build - and these bring us a sense of fulfillment.

However, in order to achieve creation, improvement, and to succeed in helping others - we need to learn first!

So I've devoted myself to the journey of lifelong learning, and hope that I also discover along the way.

This blog serves as a tool to share what I encounter on that journey.

## My Current Languages:

* Javascript || React
* Ruby || Rails
* SQL || PostgreSQL, MySQL

## My Next Learning Goals:

* Improving my C++
* Delving into Scala

## A few other things about me:

* I'm from Long Island, NY, and currently living in **Queens, NY**.
* My favorite city is Berlin.
* I studied **Petroleum Engineering** and **Russian** at **Penn State** (We Are!)
* I love **snowboarding** and **hiking**.
* **Electronic Music** holds a special place in my heart.
* I'm E.I.T. certified.
