Here are a few projects that I am currently working on or completed.

## Teamster (in development)

## SimpleCalendar (on hold)

<a href='https://simplecalendar.jayewe.com' target='_blank'><img src='./simple-calendar.png' alt='SimpleCalendar'/></a>

A simple calendar interface - make/schedule events. Currently outdated as my CSS has well developed beyond this. 
Ideally, would like to create a new npm package for calendars in the future.

## Grocery List (in development)

<a href='https://groceries.jayewe.com' target='_blank'><img src='./groceries.png' alt='Groceries'/></a>

Not much more than a simple landing/login page right now - the idea is to allow uploading of recipe PDFs and automatically creating a grocery list from it.

## The Tale of Eric (on hold)

<a href='https://tale-of-eric.jayewe.com' target='_blank'><img src='./the-tale-of-eric.png' alt='The Tale of Eric'/></a>

A platformer game built using Phaser.

Eric is a new teaching assistant hungry for a promotion - but his troublesome students refuse to shower and stop playing League of Legends. Time to take matters into his own hands.
